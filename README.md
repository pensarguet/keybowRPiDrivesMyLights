# keybow RPi Drives My Lights
Keybow RPi drives Shelly plugs / bulbs

## Description
With the covid, and by force of circumstance, I started to work at home by obligation then by pleasure until I dedicated a room at home with my own setup. 
With a house on 2 floors, and moments when I am in a meeting, recording videos or simply available, I wanted to manage the availability of access to the room ... in short a kind of "On Air" to indicate my status. Ok, I can hear you from where you are... why didn't I just buy one? Well, it was too simple, and I like to make things!  

## Setup
So, it is quite naturally that I turned to [Raspberry](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) with its smaller form factor, [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) on which I could adapt a mini keyboard. To manage the lights, after some chat with friends on Twitter, it appears that [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud/) solutions seamed to be the most appropriate for want I wanted to do, switching on and off thanks to HTTP requests

Here are the component I used:
- [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) by [Raspberry](https://www.raspberrypi.com/)
- [GPIO Hammer Header (Solderless)](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/gpio-hammer-header?variant=35643241098) by [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/)
- [Keybow Kit (3-key)](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow-mini-3-key-macro-pad-kit?variant=27890390696019) by [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/)
- 16+Gb micro SD Memory card
- [Shelly Plug S](https://shop.shelly.cloud/shelly-plug-s-wifi-smart-home-automation#62) by [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud/)
- [Shelly Duo - RGBW](https://shop.shelly.cloud/shelly-bulb-rgbw-e27-wifi-smart-home-automation#436) by [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud/)
    
## How to use it
### Step 1 - Micro SD Card Setup
